# AllSight_Sim : TACTO implementation for the AllSight tactile Sensor

## Overview
This package provides a simulation environment for a small 3D structured vision-based finger sensor called AllSight. It integrates the AllSight model with the [TACTO](https://github.com/facebookresearch/tacto) API simulation, enabling data collection and the simulation of robotic in-hand manipulation scenarios.
